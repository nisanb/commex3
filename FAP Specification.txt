	1. Flames of Arendhal Protocol (FAP) is an application layer protocol over TCP that
	supports communication between multiple game clients and a main server. FoA is a
	MMO-RPG where players team up in a party of warriors to fight off hordes of monsters.
	FAP handles the transmission of fighting status and player decisions. clients report 
	damage attempts on monsters, and server responds with actual damage dealt, and damage
	from monsters. Character & Monster information are stored on Server, and various 
	calculations are made server-side.
	
	2. After all connected clients are Ready, the server replies with an approval message 
	containing number of monsters to fight in current play session & character's initial health points.
	
	3. Clients start dealing damage to monsters 1-by-1 using Damage requests.
	
	4.1. If monster & character were still alive when receiving the request, Server replies with approval message 
	with monster's health points left & character's health points left (monster sometimes 
	deals damage back to players).
	
	4.2. If monster was dead or character was dead when receiving the request, Server replies with a disapproval message.
	
	5. When monster is dead, or disapproval received, Clients move to next monster and repeat.

	6. If character drops below a certain HP point, client sends a Bandage request.

	7.1. If character was alive, and hasn't used all possible bandages, Server responds with approval and character's 
	current health points.

	7.2. If character was dead or used all possible bandages, Server responds with disapproval and character's current 
	health points.
	
	8. If character died, or all monsters died, a Client closes its 
	connection to Server, without waiting for acknowledgement.
	
	9. When all clients are disconnected, Server shuts down and outputs damage overview.
	
	10. Each of the following messages is transferred as a String encoded in UTF,
	   and its fields are seperated with a ' ' (space) character.
